In order to use this language on Linux you need DEZIP the archive in a folder, and open a terminal in this folder.

Then proceed with the following command :
python3 AleX.py *.AleX

You need to have Python installed.

---------------------------------

There is a file named example.AleX which contains all of the language possibilities.

Keep in mind this is nowhere near a full-fleshed language. It is just a personal project of mine! If you make program with it, I would love to see! Send me an e-mail!

Thanks to howCode for the massive help.
